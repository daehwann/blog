# 2016-01-03-introduction

_The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel's supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll's loyal butler.

Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

There are currently three themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
* [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com)

## What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included \(layouts, config, [404](https://github.com/daehwann/blog/tree/7199408a396862e51dfd21bdfb3986f9d5a7fa35/_posts/%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/404.html), [RSS feed](https://github.com/daehwann/blog/tree/7199408a396862e51dfd21bdfb3986f9d5a7fa35/_posts/%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](https://github.com/daehwann/blog/tree/7199408a396862e51dfd21bdfb3986f9d5a7fa35/_posts/%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/about/README.md)\)
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts \(time-based, because Jekyll\) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

## Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari \(mobile and desktop\), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

## Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/daehwann/blog/tree/7199408a396862e51dfd21bdfb3986f9d5a7fa35/_posts/%7B%7B%20site.github.repo%20%7D%7D) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
